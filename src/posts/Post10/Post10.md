## Blue Origin News

One piece of news this week is the announcement of a consortium headed by Blue Origin to win the NASA lunar lander contract that is up for grabs.
Teaming up with traditional aerospace contractors this has been interpreted in two ways. The first optimistic opinion is that here is a disruptive company converting others to make a proposal for the upcoming contract. A quick skim of the facts would make this plausible as many followers of events see Blue Origin as a disruptive force.

I don’t interpret this as that. For the last 2 years and certainly so for the last 12 months, I have tended to interpret events as Blue Origin looking for opportunities much as traditional contractors do. The evidence for this is not based on a great deal as there isn’t a large body of evidence one way or another.

The proposed vehicle is very uninspired. The timeframe and specification proposed by NASA certainly suggests uninspired. The conservatism is reinforced by being a fixed price contract. For those that follow the SLS charades there is a cognitive dissonance here. The SLS is a cost plus gravy train while this much more risky proposal is fixed price. The split in contractors follows the management of the contract as well. Northrop Grumman would be very valuable as a partner in navigating this contract and the NASA management. All of this conspires to a conservative design. Tweak what you are doing already and get the product delivered. 

It also shows that the contractors do not trust NASA. These companies are capable of much more but aren’t willing to make such a pitch. They likely do not believe a more ambitious proposal would win nor would they make money from the inevitable delays that will come their way while trying to constrain costs. The management of BO would be well aware of this.

There are also spreading the pork considerations at work here as well. As a greater spread of jobs is politically beneficial but not cost beneficial that will even be seen as a plus to the proposal. When considering Boeing and Lockheed Martin are far worse on cost, this would likely be a bargain.

Those other two contractors in reality are not likely to win this contract considering their very poor performance with Orion and SLS. Reality would suggest those two are completely unable to get a program running with so much engineering required for the first time. While NG is not much better, it is the junior partner here. And that may be politically palatable after the James Webb Telescope debacle.

It is also likely to be pitched as the politically dependable option when cast against whatever SpaceX is proposing. SpaceX technically is the front runner with all of the experience at landing, orbital rockets, communications and avionics. Politically they would be weaker though.

One final thought are the awards bestowed upon Jeff Bezos. BO has yet to do anything grand in aerospace yet has awards rained upon him. This is likely due to a very afraid establishment trying to sweeten the beast and change the direction of BO towards being another part of the gang.

Just some thoughts...
