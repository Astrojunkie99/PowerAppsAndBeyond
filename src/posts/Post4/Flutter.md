My next step in the world of Web development will be exploring Flutter/Dart. My orignal aim was developing PowerApps and I fell into web development because of this as well as developing a blog for myself from scratch (and controlling the content and style as I wanted and be completely free to do so as well).

Flutter looks to be a powerful platform where I can develop apps that I want in the world of safety. Its going to be an exciting journey and as I learn I will post my progress.

The nature of the posts wont be tutorials but what I would think of as something interesting or a problem that has stumped me and finally overcome - **And there are plenty of those**
