### Starship updates

Events and book a Chuka are moving very quickly now. (As if they weren’t moving quick enough before). Now SpaceX is moving towards testing there Mark one starship. By November 6 they will commence their tension tests. The outcomes of this will then lead to a first flight. 

It is anticipated that the tension tests will verify the integrity of the main tanks of the starship. This is crucial as tanks need to be showing that there are no leaks. Oxygen leaks would be very bad news.

There are also multiple multiple launches coming up over the following few weeks.Two of the branches are anticipated to be 
Star link launches. The star link launches are crucial to SpaceX building a new revenue stream. This revenue stream will be used in part for the funding of future developments of starship. This reason is why it is vital for SpaceX. This revenue Will allow SpaceX to become fully independent of government funding. The comparative advantage that SpaceX will have the star link is expected to be very large. CompetingConstellations are simply not going to be able to compete cost wise or technology wise. And example of this is how the Starling satellites are manufactured and packed as essentially flatpacks. This feature alone jumps in my opinion Several generations that competing constellations would have taken to achieve. This is also a feature of how Elon Musk Thinks. He tends to think and great leaps and reach optimal conditions far faster.

Competing constellations are facing headwinds. And example of this is one web. Their main investor is Softbank. Softbank is facing serious Softbank is facing serious investor turmoil over their recent involvement in square space. This was an IPO that collapsed. 
Early investors in this IPO have lost multiple billions of dollars. This will without doubt expose their other investing decisions such as one Webb. When Webb is using satellites that Are i’m not optimised and use boosters that are far less cost competitive or for that matter mess competitive.

The ones but Webb problems I may soon come to a head. With a very lack of progress over the last year it is my opinion that there will come to ahead serious problems that may cause the whole venture to collapse. There are other constellations though that I expect would it would succeed.

The other important items for the week will be the upcoming tests for the crew vehicles.Both bowing and SpaceX have very important test this week. Both of these tests involve their crew escape systems and the verification of various corrections today systems. Both companies have had serious valuers with their systems over the past 12 months. SpaceX has had the most visible of these fabulous with the result being the explosion of one of their test vehicles. These fires have resulted in serious delayed delays to the program.

Fingers crossed for the week ahead.
