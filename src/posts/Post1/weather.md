description: What has led to starting this Blog
---
I am a slow learner in a number of ways - this blog is my third attempt at starting one. The first two attempts included a huge number of lessons. Far too many to list here but I will go through some of the more painfull ones.

My first lesson was not to mix style plugins. Using Bootstrap and styled components led to my creating such a mess with the styling that I found it easier just to restart instead of perservering with it all. What did I learn from it all you might say? That was easy for me. I was already massively modifying Bootstrap to get the look I wanted so it was just that for me to jump into SASS and learn that for my styling.

Lesson 1 - SASS its good for you if you really want your own styles. Mixing tools bad for me. 

The next lesson that was painful. Plan your deployment. On the second I didn't until I needed to. This caused me to have all sorts of issues. So much so that I felt that the build was going to be too fragile and likely not to work if I wanted to make upgrades into the future.

This meant prepare the deployment using Github and Netlify right from the start. It helps to see work go up as I make improvements as well.

Lesson 2 - Sort out deployment and do it. Dont wait till the last second like me.

Another lesson that caused a fatal problem was that I decided latre into development of my second attempt to add in dynamic elements - in particular I wanted to use API calls to display some content but protect my key. 

After researching this - Netlify was the best for me to do this and since I hadn't deployed I can do that as well. Good? Not so good. I couldn't get it to work and with all of the other issues I was having, decided to start again. The styling was starting to annoy me a lot by this time as well. So I cut my losses and started on the third attempt.

Benefits of multiple rodeos is getting better at this each time. The mysteries of create pages, slugs, gatsby-browser, gatsby-config etc. are getting easier to understand. As well as the style that I like.

Hopefully you will come back to this blog - I'm not limiting it to web-development at all but other topics of interest to me as well.
