The big depressing news this morning in space circles is the announcement that LockMart was awarded a very significant contract for 6 orion capsules. At cost plus.

This news is without doubt a political sop to the Texas congress delegation regarding jobs. The aim is to get support for the recently badged Artemis program. In the recent announcement about the Artemis Program's lunar lander, there was a very large public miscalculation with Huntsville awarded the lions share of the work and seemingly Houston getting the scraps in relative terms.

There are multiple issues with this situation. The first in purely economic terms is that unproductive njobs are created - always with the destruction of multiple productive ones. We can't point to the jobs destroyed and assuredly they are through higher taxes but politicians can easily point to the ones they created.

The next point to this situation is the award of cost-plus. This was not needed. The development is mostly complete (at least that is what we are told) and this is a production contract where everything is known except it isn't. Just cast your mind back to the situation 2 months ago where Falcon Heavy was rejected from an Orion test launch because the Orion's docking software wouldn't be ready and in fact wasn't started. For such a program where docking is needed and when it was touted as able to dock with the ISS it should already be complete.

This cost plus contract is really a money shower for the contractor. With the current behaviour of the Nasa management in awarding *illions (add m, b or tr - it doesnt matter) for failing it really cant get any better for LockMart.

There would appear that part of the deal for political support is the award of the Cost Plus contract instead of the previously planned Fixed Price/Lump sum contract.

The third point to this is that $18 Billion has already been awarded. And all to show for this is a test launch of a boiler plate sample and a mostly ready engineering version that will not have full avionics or life support. To give context to this phenominal amount of money - it would get you a complete aircraft carrier group. All this money for a small capsule. One calculation had it as worth more than solid gold.

The sad part of the whole exercise is that this is generally bipartisan. It enjoys support by both sides. The only hope for stopping this is a Congress that is frozen in persuit of Donalt Trump.

Finally contrast this with the construction in Boca Chica with Starship getting 3 raptor engines yesterday. This gives the ship almost as much lift as a Falcon 9 first stage and all for a second stage.
