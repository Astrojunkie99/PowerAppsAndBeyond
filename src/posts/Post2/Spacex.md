Starship development is powering on in Boca Chica, Texas. Construction appears to be fevered when compared to the previous 30 years - which could be said to be incremental at best.

This week the work appears to be focused on attaching the landing fins/legs and the canards. One aspect of the whole construction is that it is done outdoors and it has a old-school industrial feel to it. One Reddit comment was to the effect that having this constructed outdoors gives confidence that if need be repairs could be made on the Moon or Mars - how very true. One other thought is that among the first people to set foot on Mars will be at least one or two who will be very skilled at stainless steel welding.

The other great aspect is that this is 100% private commercial with no govt funding. Without govt funding means no politics and no govt oversight which in my humble opinion would strangle this effort. This project is accellerating because it has to in order to survive. 

Contrast the SLS. This project has been meandering along since 2005 under one name or another to the tune of $2-3Billion a year. Posssibly more if we add in all of the extra items required but not officially part of the program. This program may get to a test launch in 2021. The paid program shills would have us believe that the program is the most efficient option there is. Boeing is sparing no expense in this. Considering the massacre its had with its 737 Max program among others - it could hardly afford to lose this cash cow at this time.

Then we have what I term the smarty pants class. On many forums, especially those graced by "experts" there is often disbelief and open scepticism of the construction that is occuring before our eyes. Its not possible is what they say - as if they know how to build Mars class ships. When it comes to building Mars class ships, no-one has experience but Spacex is the only one having a go at it.

Look at it from this perspective:
1. It is using stainless steel
2. The rocket engines are already built and are now flight tested
3. Landing is a solved problem
4. Guidance and software control is a solved problem
5. There are no revolutionary components or technology

It is relatively simple to build and can be tackled much like ocean going ships.  Anyway, we shall see what happens over the next 12 months. Odds are that this will make it ot orbit before SLS - unthinkable 3 years ago.
