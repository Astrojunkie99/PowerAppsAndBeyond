## 30,000 More Satellites

A very interesting development is the filing by SpaceX to deploy 30,000 more satellites. This is on top of their already proposed 12,000 constellation of which they have deployed 60 already and are just a week away from deploying a further 60. You can read the story broken by SpaceNews [here](https://spacenews.com/spacex-submits-paperwork-for-30000-more-starlink-satellites/).

In part this has been an attempt to develop funding streams that are independent of government funding and the political vagaries involved.

It plays as well to their very unique strength of massively repeatable and reusable flights with Falcon 9 and soon Starship. With their industry leading cheapest prices of \$50 million for external customers, they have a massive comparative advantage. Now this is not the internal price they will have for themselves. This cost price for themselves will be lower again. By how much is just a guess. Whatever it is, it will be at marginal cost because of their other customers.

With all of these costs in mind, we are looking at a large cost reduction compared to closest competitors such as Onespace. Onespace is launching on Soyuz with less than optimal satellites. In the end they may be a factor of ten more expensive if not more.

It will be interesting to see how this pans out and how much pressure will be applied to competitors to respond. I predict that of the current group, only Amazon can respond as they will be as vertically integrated without the legacy systems and mindset not to copy SpaceX.

Edit - I have thought further on the implications unspoken so far. The first is cost. The impied cost is lower than expected and as such they are able to deploy a constellation that reaches more customers and at a more competitive rate. This means that they have done the sums and believe they are more than competitive with terrestrial carriers in more built up areas rather than the fringes. The second is launches and the numbers. 42,000 satellites in 10 years say, as that is now the proposed number. We know that means 4200 per year minimum. At 60 per flight - we will get 70 per year or roughly 1300 tonnes per year. Mind boggling numbers. [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station#Structure) quotes ISS mass at 420 tonnes and took 13 years. SpaceX is proposing to blast 3 times this much tonnage each year on average. This will not actually be the case as there will be lead in years as getting to volume and the out years will be less. But still massive by any measure.
