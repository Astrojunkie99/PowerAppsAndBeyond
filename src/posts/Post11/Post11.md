# Flutter Impressions

Flutter for me has over the last couple of weeks given me some strong first impressions. These impressions are giving me a very favourable outlook on flutter.
My first impression was a strong sense of resemblance with React. This would be a benefit and it is logical that Flutter would share a resemblance. React is a reactive structure that is component driven. Flutter is also component driven - namely its widgets. 

The next impression I got was a strengthening community. Although young, there is a strong community already. This community is involved in building packages that offer all sorts of functionality that is missing from the core package. Keeping in mind that Flutter has been around for 2 years and started as a Google experiment this is quite positive. A strong community is a sign of a lasting stack.

There is already a good body of resources when it comes to learning flutter. There are already tutorials on YouTube as well several articles on various aspects of Flutter. A strong learning resource will greatly assist in building a strong following. The ease of learning will also enhance this. Itâ€™s not difficult to get a basic app going and see some fairly encouraging early results. This is a definite plus as it encourages further learning early on.

A benefit with Flutter is the ability to develop an app for both iOS and Android. The difference lies in the widgets being iOS specific or Android specific. This should shorten the development process for apps for either platform and improve the earning power of independent developers like myself.

The final takeaway for me is that it is generally intuitive as well as structured in a way where the styling is a part of the widget and not in separate files like HTML and CSS are. This is fundamentally as it should be.
