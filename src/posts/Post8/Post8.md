## SLS Cores Ordered

One of the big news items for the week has been the reporting of NASA ordering at cost plus up to 10 more cores for the SLS from Boeing. 
This move to me is purely political. It is a signal to the Senators from Alabama to support this and make the deals necessary to get through the House of Congress. The week in Congress has been dominated by the typical theatre of concerned Chairs of Committees with the program as proposed. Now in typical politics this concern will disappear if the right side deal is placed on the table for them.
Another view that is popular is that because of the current President this program is dead in the water. Now this isn’t the case. Both parties believe they have a shot at the presidency and this will benefit whoever it is. In fact it is more likely to benefit a Democratic president as a slip of a year will take it in to the second term. Even if it doesn’t it is perfect as a lead in to their re-election. 
In the end if Trump wins and a schedule slip occurs then this will also be a benefit to a successor President. As is likely after the end of a second Trump term and there is a flip, then that President will get all of the glory and not Trump. Those will be the scenarios that will be calculated on both sides of the aisle and it may be on those that this program ultimately slips through.

Personally, this is a colossal waste of money and with commercial space moving ahead to scale far beyond what this program is capable of, I can only see this program heading for infamy as one of the worst examples of groups conspiring to strip taxpayers from their money.
